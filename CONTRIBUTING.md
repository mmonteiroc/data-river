## Backlog of Tasks

We maintain a **backlog of tasks** in our [issues section](https://github.com/orgs/softflow24/projects/2/views/1). These tasks are created and curated by the repo maintainers to help guide contributors toward meaningful work. Below is how you can pick a task from the backlog and start working on it:

1. **Browse the issues**:  
   Head over to our [issues page](https://github.com/softflow24/data-river/issues) to explore tasks that are open for contribution. Look for labels like `good first issue`, `bug`, or `feature request` to find tasks that match your skill level or interests.

2. **Pick a task**:  
   Once you find an issue you'd like to work on, leave a comment in the issue thread to let others know that you're taking it on. This helps avoid duplicate work and ensures that the task is being handled.

3. **Start working**:  
   After you've claimed an issue, follow the steps in the **Getting Started** section to set up the project locally. Be sure to keep the maintainers updated by commenting on the issue if you run into any problems or need clarification.

4. **Submit your work**:  
   Once you're done, follow the **Submitting Your Work** section to create a pull request and get your work reviewed and merged.

We encourage everyone to pick tasks from the backlog so we can work together efficiently and make progress as a team!

## Submitting Your Work

When you're ready to submit your contribution, follow these steps:

1. **Create a new branch**:  
   Always work on a new branch, not directly on the `main` branch. Use a descriptive name for your branch, like `feature/new-feature` or `bugfix/fix-crash`:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-branch-name

   ```

2. **Make your changes**:
   After making the necessary changes, commit them with a clear and concise commit message that describes what you did:
   `git commit -m "Short description of changes"`

3. **Push to your fork**:
   Push your changes to your forked repository:
   `git push origin feature/your-branch`
4. **Create a pull request (PR)**:
   Go to the original repository and open a pull request. Be sure to link the issue you’re addressing and follow any pull request templates.

## Review Process

After you submit your pull request, one of the maintainers will review your changes. During the review process:

1. **Feedback**:  
   You may receive feedback or requests for changes. Don't worry—this is a normal part of the contribution process and helps improve the quality of the project.

2. **Respond to feedback**:  
   Make any requested changes by pushing new commits to your branch. Be sure to address any comments and ask questions if anything is unclear.

3. **Approval**:  
   Once everything looks good, your pull request will be approved and merged into the `main` branch. If there are any issues, we’ll work with you to resolve them.
